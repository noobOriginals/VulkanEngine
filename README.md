# **NOTE**

### To build this project, you currently need **[CMake](https://cmake.org/)**, **[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)** and the **[Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)**.  

## CMake

Go to the **[CMake website download page](https://cmake.org/download/)** and intall the CMake GUI.  
Then follow **[these steps](#building-with-the-cmake-gui)**.  

## Vulkan SDK

Get the Vulkan SDK installer for your platform from **[LunarG's website](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)**.  
Then install it with all components (main interest is GLM, for later math transformations).  
With it installed, create a new folder on your computer named "**vulkan**". Then copy the folders from the "**Include**" folder of the SDK there. Also copy the "**vulkan-1.lib**" from the "**Lib**" folder. 

## GLFW

Get the GLFW library from **[their website](https://www.glfw.org/)** or by **[cloning it on github](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)**.  
Then follow **[these steps](#building-with-the-cmake-gui)** to build the GLFW library with CMake.    
In the build directory provided to CMake, after you build the files, you should have a folder named "**src**".
Navigate to "**src/Debug**", and copy the "**glfw3.lib**" to your "**vulkan**" folder.  
Then go back to your GLFW source folder and copy the contents of the "**include**" folder (the "**GLFW**" folder) to your "**vulkan**" folder.  

## Building with the CMake GUI
Open the CMake GUI, then select the source code directory.  
Now select a build directory (you have to create it yorself first).  
Now click "**Configure**", and choose your generator (I recommend **Ninja** for Mac and Linux, and **Visual Studio** for Windows). Then click "**Configure**" again to save the settings.  
Then click "**Generate**", to generate the build files.
Go to your build folder, and:  
- If you're on windows and you're using VS, open the generated "**.sln**" file and build the solution inside VS.
- If you're using Ninja, open the build folder in a terminal tab and run the `ninja` command in that folder.  

You can also use cmake to build you files, like this:  

    $ cmake --build <build folder> --confing <configuration (usually 'Debug' or 'Release')> --target <if generator is Ninja: 'all'; if generator is VS: 'ALL_BUILD'>  

And CMake will also tell you which is the binary output directory. For example:  

    $ cmake --build build --config Debug --target ALL_BUILD
    MSBuild version 17.12.12+1cce77968 for .NET Framework

        Checking File Globs
        Copying resources into birnay output folder
        Engine-test.vcxproj -> .\bin\Debug\Engine-test.exe
  
Now you should see the binary files that were generated by building in the binary output folder.  

# **Building the project**
Follow **[these steps](#building-with-the-cmake-gui)** again, with the project folder as the source, and a build folder created inside the project folder as build.  
Then you can run the generated binary `/bin/<config>/Engine-test.exe` to see the result of this project.
